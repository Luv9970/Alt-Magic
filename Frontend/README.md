# 🖼️ Alt-Magic Dashboard — Frontend (React)

This is the **frontend dashboard** of the **Alt-Magic App**, a single-page Shopify-integrated tool that helps merchants identify and fix missing alt text across product, blog, and page images.

It fetches image data from a backend (Express API) and displays:
- 📸 Total number of images
- ⚠️ Number of images missing alt text
- 🛠 Individual image entries with a “Generate Alt” button

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **React** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **Axios** (for API calls)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **Backend**: Express + Firebase (accessed via HTTP API)
